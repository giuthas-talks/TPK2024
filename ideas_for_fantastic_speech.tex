\frame{\frametitle{Land acknowledgement - TPK}
\footnotesize
We honor the Indigenous people whose ancestral lands we reside on: Clackamas,
Multnomah, bands of the Chinook, the Tualatin, Kalapuya, Molalla, Yamhill, and
many other Indigenous tribes whose homes were along the Columbia and Willamette
Rivers. Through genocide, relocation, termination, and assimilation, various
governments (past and present) have stolen this land, yes, but also language,
ceremony, food, housing, education, healthcare, governance, medicines and
kinship.

We recognize we are benefiting from this land as a result of a legacy of
colonization. Land acknowledgments do not exist in a past tense, or historical
context: colonialism is a current, ongoing process, and we seek to build an
understanding of our present participation. 

As guests on these lands, we respect the work of Indigenous leaders and
families, and pledge to make ongoing efforts recognize their resilience and
resistance. We commit to continuing to educate ourselves and others about the
history and peoples of the land we occupy and honor that history as stewards of
this space. We are also committed to the Native Land Beer Collaboration to
celebrate Native American Heritage Month, in addition to finding other ways to
give back financially as we grow.

\frame{\frametitle{Notes on content and some housekeeping}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item I want to keep this a safe space of mutual respect.
  \item There may be discussion of topics such as colonization, oppression,
  pejoratives, etc. in this workshop, but if you want them or any other topics
  kept out, we will do our best to do so.
  \item Touching on 'political' topics will be inevitable though.
  \item Slides are available at \url{https://github.com/giuthas-talks/TPK2024}
  \end{itemize}

      \begin{itemize}
      \item Pertti Palo
      \item I've got a couple of degrees (loosely speaking) in engineering.
      \item I've also got a PhD in Phonetics.
      \item I have no formal qualifications in Borrowing a Language, but I do
      know a lot about speech production, and\ldots
      \end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{I do have some background}
\begin{itemize}
  \item I am not a text linguist but rather a phonetician and a speech
  researcher.
  \item When I say 'language' I mainly mean spoken language today. 
  \item Besides a speech researcher with 20+ years of experience, I've been an
  RPG enthusiast for 30+ years. 
  \item Recently I've also started training as an oral storyteller which has
  some interesting connections with RPGs and science.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{What we'll do}
\begin{itemize}
  \item I'll talk about dragon speech if you want me to.
  \item If there's not too many of us, we'll go round the table and talk about
  the projects each of you is working on, concentrating on questions about
  speech and how it interacts with world and story.
  \item I've got some ideas to play around with on the next slides, but we
  don't need to look at those. 
\end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{Ideas to play around with}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Dragon speech and physics (such as they are) and the consequences to the
  world or story.
  \item Humanoids who do not use sound as a means of communication (and possibly
  can not perceive it).
  \item The base code of reality being a spoken (/speakable) programming
  language.
  \item Social and/or physical environment of speech and language in a world or
  story.
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Some more ideas to play around with}
\begin{itemize}
  \item If the world is magical, language can be too: 
  \begin{itemize}
    	\item Unholy, vowel rich language (cf. Moorcock): hääyöaie (i.e. you can
    	do this with Finnish)
    	\item "Guttural, evil language" was not a great idea to start with.
  \end{itemize}  
  \item Homophone words (think 'for' and 'four') and homonyms (see
  \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonym} for details) and other plays on words
  can be part of a story ("Pedo mellon a minno.")
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Mix this with dialects and you can produce a pretty solidly confusing
    situation.
    \item Working these into game play may not be the easiest though.  
  \end{itemize}
  \item Whistled and drummed languages (they are a real thing in the real world)
  \item Singing
\end{itemize}
