[täältä](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Ropecon2023/blob/main/kielen_lainaaminen_ja_fantastinen_puhe.pdf).

A talks and a workshops workshop I gave at Ropecon in Helsinki in July 2023. These evolved 
from two talks at [Indiana Comicon 2022 (slides in English)](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Comicon2022) 
and two talks and two workshops (delivered in Finnish and English) at 
[Ropecon 2022 (slides in English)](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Ropecon2022):

In the next iterations, there will be more and more interactivity and especially the second part will
in the future be a walk-in clinic rather than a program with a schedule.
