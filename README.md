# Ideas for ((un)real) speech

A workshop I gave at TPK in Portland, OR in June 2024. It evolved from two
talks at [Indiana Comicon 2022 (slides in
English)](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Comicon2022) and two talks and two
workshops (delivered in Finnish and English) at [Ropecon 2022 (slides in
English)](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Ropecon2022) and in [Ropecon 2023
(slides in Finnish)](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Ropecon2023)

presentations.
